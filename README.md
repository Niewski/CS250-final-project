1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with active engagement and clear communication with stakeholders to understand their goals, preferences, and pain points. User stories bridge the gap between user needs and technical implementation. By capturing requirements in a simple, user-focused format user stories help ensure that development focuses on delivering value to the end-user. They promote clarity and alignment among team members and stakeholders while providing a clear "definition of done" through acceptance criteria.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development iteratively, focusing on delivering functional increments and continuously refining based on feedback. Agile methodologies provide a structured yet flexible framework that is incorporated in my current job, and will likely be throughout the rest of my career. Key processes include:

- Sprint Planning: Breaking down the workload into achievable goals.

- Daily Standups: Ensuring alignment and addressing blockers.

- Backlog Refinement: Keeping work prioritized and ready for development.

- Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives: Gathering feedback and improving processes.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development requires collaboration, effective communication, and accountability. A good team member actively participates in meetings, shares knowledge, and helps resolve challenges that may block progress. They respect the contributions of others, and provide constructive feedback to promote a positive and productive team environment. In this course we demonstrated these principles by working closely with the Product Owner to clarify user stories and collaborating during sprint events to ensure all team members were aligned and setup to succeed. By embracing Agile values, such as transparency and adaptability, good team members contribute to delivering high-quality software that meets user needs.
